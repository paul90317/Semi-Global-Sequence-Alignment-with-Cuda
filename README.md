# Semi-Sequence-Alignment-with-Cuda  
## What I have done
As the topic, semi sequence alignment with cuda technique. However, I don't do this by one program but two.  
1. the program [semi_interval](./src/semi_interval/main.cu), will calculate out best score with semi x,y first, then generate x,y's semi inteval.  
2. the program [alignment](./src/semi_interval/main.cu), will align the sequence x,y with the interval, although this is global align, but we have semi interval to do this, so result will as same as just do local sequence alignment.  
## Config
You can edit config in [config.h](./src/headers/config.h), this config is a part of program, so it will optialize with compiler.  
In this file, you can edit output file location, cuda, sequence x,y's start and end is free or fixed and so on.
You need to change score matrix in [score.json](score.json), and execute command
```
python scripts\load_score_matrix.py
```
to generate `score.txt` in temp folder, this is the input of CUDA|CPP Programs.  
Or, you can also use command
```
make gpu_test
```  
to run all the thing you need to do.
## How to use  
just run
```
make
```
you can get all the CUDA|CPP program executable.
there are three program executable.
1. `semi_interval.exe`  
get the best interval, you need to config semi setting in [config.h](src/headers/config.h).  
**command:**  
`semi_interval.exe [x.txt] [t.txt] [best interval.txt] [score.txt]`  
    * `[x.txt] [y.txt]`: the files need to contain input sequence.  
    * `[best interval.txt]`: best intervals store in this file.
    * `[score.txt]`: score matrix store will be get from this file, see [config](##Config)
2. `alignment.exe`  
get alignment using the `[best interval.txt]` generated by `semi_interval.exe`, this is global alignment but using the interval in `[best interval.txt]`  
**command:**  
`alignment.exe [x.txt] [y.txt] [best interval.txt] [score.txt] [alignment.txt]`  
    * `[x.txt] [y.txt]`: the files need to contain input sequence.  
    * `[best interval.txt]`: best interval should be got in this file (only get first line (interval)).
    * `[score.txt]`: score matrix store will be get from this file, see [config](##Config)
    * `[alignment.txt]`: alignment will be stored in this file.
3. `cpu.exe`  
just for testing speed, only calculate and print out global sequence alignment score.  
**command:**  
`cpu.exe [x.txt] [y.txt] [score.txt]`  
    * `[x.txt] [y.txt]`: the files need to contain input sequence.  
    * `[score.txt]`: score matrix store will be get from this file, see [config](##Config)

You can alse run scipts
* `make cpu_test`  
just use cpu run global alignment score in tasks, there is no semi function, so it just let you can compare cpu's performance with gpu's or, the global alignment score is realy the same as the program run with cuda(set x,y's start,end to fixed).  
* `make gpu_test`  
calcuate best score and its interval with cuda, then generate best score's alignment with cuda and all interals generated by `semi_interval.exe`, and this program also check the alignments's socre.  
* `make clean_tasks`  
clean alignments in tasks  
* `make clean`  
clean *.exe  

Here is data structure
```txt
tasks
>---[hello world]
    >---x.txt
    >---y.txt
>---[fist alignment]
    >---x.txt
    >---y.txt
>---[second alignmet]
    >---x.txt
    >---y.txt
>---[alignment 3]
    >---x.txt
    >---y.txt
```
after command `make gpu_test`  
```txt
tasks
>---[hello world]
    >---x.txt
    >---y.txt
    >---out
        >---best.txt

## Performance  
### imporve log
#### all
* coalescing  
I change the array storage to fit coalescing, the this improve the performace.  
#### semi_interval  
* reduce memory of afg_unit  
make #if to let memory of afg_unit reduce, the improve is crazy.  
#### alignment
* end point 2D alignment  
make more big end point to forbidden trivial calling gpu kernel when interval is too small.  

### comparison
